# Flexless

Here at Caktus we love Flexbox! And we love making styling easier with Less,
so we combined two great things. Flexless makes Flexbox less difficult to support
across a wide range of supported browsers.

## Mixins

### `flex-layout`

Initiate an element as a Flex container, including all the backfilled prefixing necessary:

    .flex-layout();
